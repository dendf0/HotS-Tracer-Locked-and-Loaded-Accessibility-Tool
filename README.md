# HotS Tracer Locked and Loaded Accessibility Tool
Accessibility tool for Heroes of the Storm Tracer's Locked and Loaded talent.

Automatically reactivates Reload within the last 50% of its cast time to increase Tracer's Basic Attack damage by 40% for that magazine.

Essentially, the tool automatically presses the D button to make Locked and Loaded a passive talent that gives you 40% bonus damage unconditionally.
